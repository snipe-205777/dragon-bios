When your home is formed of trees ripped from the ground and taken far from their origin, it can be expected you may be taking something else along with you, especially when that origin is the Starwood Strand. No one can tell you where Loreley came from, or when she arrived; she was just [i]there[/i]. Well, kind of: she does have a tendency to always hover at the edge of sight, slipping into the trees if you try to look directly at her.

Although it is unclear exactly how she spends her time, it is common belief in the clan that it is only due to her good graces that their lair remains a safe haven, as the Starwood Shade are known to create complex illusions to protect their woods. She is therefore regarded as a kind of fickle guardian spirit and even the youngest, silliest hatchling knows not to anger her. After all, more than one dragon has vanished after following her into the dark.
