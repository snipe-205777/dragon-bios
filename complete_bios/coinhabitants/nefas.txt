Although few have seen this elusive dragon, and claims are usually met with deep scepticism, she nonetheless casts a dark shadow over the clan. Do not ignore your parents, or it may be your spreadsheets she next takes up residence in. Always eat what's on your plate, or she might just start to nibble on your carefully composed formulae. Stay up past your bedtime? Well, now you're just [i]asking[/i] for her to shift your rows around and delete your most important cells.

All these statements are, of course, false: the spreadsheet witch does not discriminate. The best manners and most lovely disposition in the world will be of no help to you if your sheets happen to be in her path. She means no harm by it; it is simply her way to make a living. Would you really be so cruel as to deny a poor traveller a meal and a bed for the night?

Perhaps [i]that[/i] was your sin.
