Nergui is playful. If there's one thing about her the clan is in complete agreement over, that is it.

Born in the Southern Icefield, Nergui always tearfully claims that she was driven out of her birth clan. She will tell you that a child who would never grow up was of no use to the harsh dragons fighting for survival in the cold, empty lands. And then she will refuse to say any more on the matter. Some whisper that the best lies are kept simple.

Despite not having close friends among the other hatchlings of the clan, Nergui is always friendly with everyone and willing to help whenever it is needed. "You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar," Ezhno always reminds the children.

When not in the lair, Nergui loves to find a quiet space in the Starwood Strand, completely alone. She must have good instincts, or the Arcanist's blessing, considering how many lone dragons go into those parts and never come out.

When visitors are about to leave the clan, Nergui looks up at them with wide eyes and says she has something she wants to show them on their way out. It's a moderate distance away from the lair, but it's well worth the journey.

You will come and see, won't you?
