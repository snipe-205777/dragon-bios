Once upon a time there lived two dragons who were the worst of enemies. Their warring always darkened the faces of those nearby as their bitterness and screams filled the air and it was clear that they would do anything to make the other suffer. They were blind to the fate of all others and it was common for them to greet any who stood in their way with claws and teeth, or perhaps a devastating blast of magic.

It is the way of things for such beings to attract attention, and this case was no different. A group of powerful sorcerers banded together to curse the pair. They would be returned to hatchlings and never grow up. In this way it would be ensured that they lost their bloodthirst and destructive ability, instead becoming small and powerless. Nowadays they spend their time relaxing in the sun and playing make believe that they are just regular hatchlings. Mostly they even seem to believe it.

This is a fairy tale, and every word is true.
