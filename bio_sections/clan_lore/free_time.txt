The main indoor social space is the Hall, a large room in the northwest corner with an earthen floor. As well as forming the walls, woven tree branches provide many ledges of various sizes and several small nooks tucked away for added privacy or peace and quiet. Dragons can be found all over the space, chatting, playing games and otherwise socialising. The Hall is often the space used for arranged gatherings of the entire clan.

The other main communal area is the clearing in the centre of the lair. This wide open space provides plenty of room to relax and the pool in the middle is often used for cooling down in the heat or simply splashing around, while the large solitary tree at the eastern end provides shade. Open-air clan gatherings take place here, with the exception of those centred around stargazing. The best stargazing spot in the lair is from the treetops above the Hall and a dragon or two can be seen up there most nights.

Pergamon's library provides reading material to all who want it and they are constantly acquiring new volumes. A trip to Borvo's bathhouse is another essential relaxation method and Nasnan often puts on performances of song and dance.
