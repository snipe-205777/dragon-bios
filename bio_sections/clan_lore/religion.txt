The clan as a whole adheres to the worship of the Eleven, and of the Arcanist in particular, but for the most part religion is an informal and personal thing without a large impact on daily life. The clan emphasises themes of duality and balance, exemplified by the roots and branches of the trees that form their home.

Life is believed to come from the rocks, trees and sky, and so these elements are all present at the time of hatching. The nesting area is on a satellite island a little way above the main island, bringing it closer to the sky. The crystals of the nests provide the necessary rocks and a line of trees protects the nests on either side, with a few branches woven inwards to overhang the nest. These are pulled back a little way when the time comes for the eggs to hatch, leaving the nest open to the sky.

After death, the body is returned to these elements: first the blood to the rocks, then the flesh to the trees, and finally the powdered bones to the sky. A small wooden figure is carved into a shape relevant to the deceased and their name or name symbol is carved into the base. These are then kept in alcoves along the passages of the Underneath.
