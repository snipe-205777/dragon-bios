In the early days of the clan, the pool in the clearing and the stream flowing from it were used for bathing. When Borvo showed up, he saw the potential for a far more sophisticated system and set about converting an unused section of the lair into a bathhouse complex. The resulting arrangement is divided into sections, housing a range of rooms. There are hot baths, cold baths, baths fragranced with petals brought by Nimini, baths delicately infused with blends of spices. Some are open to the sky, and in others the water constantly flows past and onwards or pours downwards from high above. And then there are the saunas, the hot stones, the mud pools.

Every dragon is welcome here, from new hatchlings to short-term visitors to established clan members. Borvo smiles and chats to each of them as he makes his rounds and is always happy to lend a hand where needed, whether it is advising on the best pools for an individual or giving a massage. His patient nature and the relaxing atmosphere makes this one of the top choices for a youngster looking to lend a hand around the clan, and it is not uncommon to see one or two dragging bags of supplies around or gossiping with guests.
