In the long summer evenings, when the clan lazes in the shade at the edges of the clearing, Nasnan's voice is low and gentle on the still air, the only sound among a world trying to conserve just a little energy. When the weather finally breaks and the clan takes shelter from the storm, the rain provides a percussive backdrop as she leads the hatchlings in chants to banish the thunder. During the winter when blizzards rage her tones become ever louder and wilder, meshing and mingling with the howling of the winds outside.

Throughout the clan's daily lives, her melodies accompany them; as they celebrate and work and play and grieve the threads of her voice weave themselves into the structure of the walls, nestling alongside the branches, leaves, and blossoms. And when she snuggles down with Kevin at the end of a long day her song is quiet and slow, lulling her overexuberant girlfriend into a calm sleep.
