Born on leap day, Mozart was named in honor of the Court's faerie king. Hailing from the Pale Court, all of Mozart's line are gifted in the art of light bending and illusion magic, but Mozart inherited the rather unusual ability to freeze time. The firefly-like baubles that float around him are manifestations of his magic and are sent out to demarcate the boundaries of his time spells. He can also slow the timeline of specific objects or creatures, enabling them to age more slowly and live longer.
