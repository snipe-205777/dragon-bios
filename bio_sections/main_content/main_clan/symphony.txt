Life in Symphony's birth clan was crowded, to say the least. Too many dragons crammed into a small lair and there never seemed to be enough resources to go around. It was easy for one small fae hatchling to be ignored and forgotten about.

Symphony wanted to see more of the world. He wanted a place of his own. And so one day he and his best friend Serenade slipped away.

The two hatchlings soon discovered that they were completely unprepared for life in the Outside World. Catching their own food, sheltering from the weather and navigating the sometimes treacherous territory, they learnt from experience.

The Arcanist must have been looking out for them, though, as they managed to set up a temporary lair in a bountiful area of the Crystalspine Reaches, where their first clutch of hatchlings was born. With time more dragons joined them from other clans and the clan moved to a more permanent base in the Starwood Strand.

These days, Symphony spends his days exploring the mountains around him and all their strange and intriguing features and inhabitants. His nights are spent with the nocturnal wildlife under the stars.

Although the clan has no official hierarchical system, Symphony is quite influential, being one of the clan's founders. He is uncomfortable with this and often tries to keep his opinions quiet in order to avoid swaying any decisions in important clan matters.
