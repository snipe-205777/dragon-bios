Kirea was born from an abandoned egg found in the Starwood Strand in the early days of the clan. She has always been close with Gwydion, who hatched on the same day and grew up with her.

Even as a hatchling, Kirea showed a keen interest in the acquisition of Stuff. Clan founders and adoptive parents Symphony and Serenade managed to direct this in a useful way and she grew up to manage the buying of many of the clan supplies.

She does a remarkable job at saving the treasure for the more important things, although she has been known to splurge all the savings on an impulse buy without consulting the rest of the clan or considering whether it is really necessary. It usually works out in the end, however, and everyone agrees that whatever she bought is a nice thing to have around.

Usually.
