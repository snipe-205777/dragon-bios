Despite the fact that Kevin only speaks in squawks, she always makes it [i]very[/i] clear exactly what she wants. Often behaving more like a bird than a dragon, she pops out of nowhere and fixes you with a hard look until you give in. When not "playing" with the hatchlings (and various scary-looking objects), she can be found snuggled in her hidey hole wedged in near the baths or perched in the lone tree in the clearing, watching over the lake and surprising those who come through the portal from the Voidspace.

While she can appear threatening and hostile to some, she is fiercely protective towards those clanmates who have managed to get on her good side. She will guard them to the best of her ability from everything from rain and falls to rocs and other less favoured clanmates. And when everything appears calm and safe, she makes a very good picnic companion or a nap buddy.
