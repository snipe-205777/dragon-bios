His brother tells him he slept among the flower petals and tangled undergrowth as a hatchling. He does not remember this. He remembers nothing before the sound of Hiram's voice calling to him, pulling him, and then they were here, where the walls themselves are made of twisted blossoming branches, and the roots below hold the soft soil above the ground.

It is among these dark underground tunnels that he spends his days, encouraging the fickle limbs to adhere to their positions lining the corridors, to not reach across, choking them and shutting off veins. Only at night does he make his way up to the realms above, when the overarching blue sky does not fill his heart with loss and longing. He has nothing to long for - his life here is complete and joyful - but something about that empty expanse evokes a loneliness he can't explain. The gentle stars dull that feeling somewhat and allow him to relax and enjoy the open air and the stunning array of nighttime blooms.

The ground beneath his feet appears firm and solid but sometimes he feels it roll and pitch, swaying as he walks from one area to another. When this happens he moves to his nest underneath the bathhouse, where he feels himself rocked gently to sleep in the unmoving earth. He dreams of walkways shifting in the breeze and a faraway horizon and somewhere the distant pull of a home long gone.
